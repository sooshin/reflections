When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
local?
  If you are collaborating on projects with others or sharing code, you can use a 
  remote repository. If you are working on another computer, you can use a remote 
  repository to push changes to it.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	If keeping repositories in sync automatically, the code will change without my 
	being aware of it. When you try new features, since new features require multiple 
	commits and are more likely to have bugs, in this case, there is no need to have 
	Git automatically stay up-to-date. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forking is making a copy of an existing GitHub repository directly within the
	context of GitHub. GitHub keeps track of the number of people who have made
	forks. Cloning is a copy of a repository and it works on any two repositories.
	You can clone the someone else's repository on GitHub to your local computer. You
	can also clone the repository within a local. Branches are labels for commits,
	which happens on a single repository.

	When you want to take an original code and work on the code separately, you can
	use a fork. You can use clone when you copy entire repository to your local
	machine. When you want to preserve the master branch and try experimental
	feature, you can use branches.
