When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
local?
  If you are collaborating on projects with others or sharing code, you can use a 
  remote repository. If you are working on another computer, you can use a remote 
  repository to push changes to it.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	If keeping repositories in sync automatically, the code will change without my 
	being aware of it. When you try new features, since new features require multiple 
	commits and are more likely to have bugs, in this case, there is no need to have 
	Git automatically stay up-to-date.
